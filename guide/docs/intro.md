# Introduction

Welcome to **KernelGoat**, a purpose-built learning platform for understanding and experimenting with common vulnerabilities in Linux kernel modules. This project is designed for security researchers, enthusiasts, and students to gain hands-on experience in exploiting and analyzing kernel vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

KernelGoat includes five distinct kernel modules, each demonstrating a specific vulnerability. These modules are intentionally crafted to illustrate the concepts behind these issues, making it easier to learn their real-world implications and remediation techniques. 

The vulnerabilities included in KernelGoat are:

- **Stack Buffer Overflow**: Exploits improper bounds checking in stack memory operations.
- **Heap Overflow**: Demonstrates unsafe memory management in dynamic memory allocation.
- **Null Pointer Dereference**: Highlights the risks of dereferencing uninitialized or null memory addresses.
- **Integer Overflow**: Explores how arithmetic errors can lead to memory and logic corruption.
- **Use-After-Free (UAF)**: Shows the dangers of accessing memory that has already been deallocated.

Each module is accompanied by detailed documentation to explain the underlying mechanics of the vulnerability, along with practical examples to aid in your learning journey.

> **Warning**: KernelGoat is strictly for educational and research purposes. Exercise caution when working with these vulnerabilities, as improper handling could affect the host system.

Explore the vulnerabilities to deepen your understanding of Linux kernel security and the critical role of secure coding practices.
