Introduction:

Null pointer dereference is a critical programming flaw that occurs when a program accesses or manipulates memory through a pointer that has not been properly initialized or is explicitly set to NULL. This can result in undefined behavior, application crashes, security vulnerabilities, and system instability. Addressing this issue is crucial for building robust and secure software.

Causes of Null Pointer Dereference
1.Uninitialized Pointers: Declaring pointers without assigning them to a valid memory address.
2.Explicit Null Assignment: Setting a pointer to NULL and mistakenly dereferencing it.
3.Logic Flaws in Code: Errors in the programâ€™s control flow leading to unintended pointer usage.
4.Improper Error Handling: Ignoring memory allocation failures or incorrect function return values.
Implications of Null Pointer Dereference
-Program Crashes: Triggering segmentation faults that abruptly terminate applications.
-Security Vulnerabilities: Exploitable flaws allowing attackers to execute malicious code.
-System Instability: Causing failures in mission-critical applications or operating systems.
-Data Integrity Issues: Leading to corrupted data and unpredictable behavior.
