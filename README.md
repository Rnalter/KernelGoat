# KernelGoat
KernelGoat is a "Vulnerable by Design" kernel environment to learn and practice Linux Kernel security issues

## Rough plan

- Writing linux kernel drivers which are vulnerable to 
   - stack overflow
   - heap overflow
   - race conditions
   - to be added ...
 
 - Vulnerable Kernel driver to be pre-installed in docker images, so the practioner just needs to spin up the container, and focus on exploitation rather than putting effort on setup
 
 - Guide hosted on Gitbooks or Docusaurus for hints/diagrams and solutions
